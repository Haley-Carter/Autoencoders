In the notebook you will find an explanation of what is an `autoencoder`, how it works, and see an implementation of an `autoencoder` in `TensorFlow`. By the end of the notebook, you should be able to create simple `autoencoders` and how to apply them to problems that involves `unsupervised learning`.
